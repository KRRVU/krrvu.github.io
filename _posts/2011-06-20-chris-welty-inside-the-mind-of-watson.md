On Monday, June 27th from 4-5 pm, [Chris Welty](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Welty "Chris Welty") of the [IBM T.J. Watson Research Center](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_J._Watson_Research_Center "Thomas J. Watson Research Center"), will give a talk on [Watson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watson_(computer)) in room HG-01A05 of the VU main building.

**Title**: Inside the mind of Watson

**Abstract**: Watson is a computer system capable of answering rich natural language questions and estimating its confidence in those answers at a level of the best humans at the task. On Feb 14-16, in an historic event, Watson triumphed over the best human players of all time on the American television quiz-show, Jeopardy! In this talk I will discuss how Watson works at a high level with examples from the show.

**Bio**: Chris Welty is a Research Scientist at the IBM T.J. Watson Research Center in New York. Previously, he taught Computer Science at Vassar College, taught at and received his Ph.D. from [Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute](http://www.rpi.edu/ "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute"), and accumulated over 14 years of teaching experience before moving to industrial research. Chris' principal area of research is Knowledge Representation, specifically ontologies and the semantic web, and he spends most of his time applying this technology to [Natural Language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language "Natural language") [Question Answering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering "Question answering") as a member of the DeepQA/Watson team and, in the past, Software Engineering. Dr. Welty is a co-chair of the W3C Rules Interchange Format Working Group (RIF), serves on the steering committee of the Formal Ontology in Information Systems Conferences, is president of KR.ORG, on the editorial boards of [AI Magazine](http://www.aaai.org/ "Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence"), The Journal of Applied Ontology, and The [Journal of Web Semantics](http://www.elsevier.com/locate/websem "Journal of Web Semantics"), and was an editor in the W3C Web Ontology Working Group. While on sabbatical in 2000, he co-developed the [OntoClean](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OntoClean "OntoClean") methodology with [Nicola Guarino](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicola_Guarino "Nicola Guarino"). Chris Welty's work on ontologies and ontology methodology has appeared in CACM, and numerous other publications.
