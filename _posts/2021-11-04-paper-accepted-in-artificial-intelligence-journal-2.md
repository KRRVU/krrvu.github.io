We are proud to announce that _[Analyzing Differential Fuzzy Logic Operators](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0004370221001533?via%3Dihub)_, Emile van Krieken, Erman Acar and Frank van Harmelen is published in Artificial Intelligence Journal.

The paper presents an extensive analysis on the behaviour of a large collection of fuzzy logical operators in a differentiable learning setting. It points out a phenomenon: a strong imbalance between gradients driven by the antecedent and the consequent of the implication. In order to tackle this, it introduces a new family of fuzzy implications (called sigmoidal implications). It turns out that a non-standard combinations of logical operators which perform best in learning, yet surprisingly it seems they no longer satisfy the usual logical laws!
