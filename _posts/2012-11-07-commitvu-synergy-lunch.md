For over a year now, Data2Semantics organizes **biweekly** lunches for all COMMIT projects running at VU [Amsterdam](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.3730555556,4.89222222222&spn=0.1,0.1&q=52.3730555556,4.89222222222 (Amsterdam)&t=h "Amsterdam") under the header ‘COMMIT@VU’. These projects are [SEALINCMedia](http://sealincmedia.wordpress.com "SEALINCMedia"), [EWIDS](http://www.commit-nl.nl/projects/very-large-wireless-sensor-networks-for-well-being), [METIS](http://www.commit-nl.nl/projects/metis-dependable-cooperative-systems-for-public-safety), [e-Infrastructure Virtualization for e-Science Applications](http://www.commit-nl.nl/projects/e-infrastructure-virtualization-for-e-science-applications), [Data2Semantics](http://www.data2semantics.org), and [eFoodLab](http://www.commit-nl.nl/projects/e-foodlab).

On October 29th, we had a lively discussion about opportunities to [collaborate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaboration "Collaboration") across projects (see photo).

Concretely:

- SEALINCMedia and Data2Semantics will collaborate on **trust** and **[provenance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Provenance "Provenance")**. Trust and provenance analysis technology developed in SEALINCMedia can benefit from the extensive **provenance graphs** constructed in Data2Semantics, and vice versa.
- There is potential for integrating the **Amalgame** vocabulary alignment toolkit (SEALINCMedia) in the Linkitup service of Data2Semantics. Also, Amalgame can play a role in the **census** use case of Data2Semantics (aligning vocabularies of occupations through time)
- Both the SEALINCMedia and Data2Semantics projects are working on **annotation methodologies** and **tools**. Both adopt the [Open Annotation](http://www.openannotation.org) model, and require **multi-layered** annotations (i.e. annotations on annotations).
- eFoodlab and Data2Semantics are both working on **[annotating](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annotation "Annotation")** and **interpreting** **spreadsheet** data. We already had a joint meeting last year on this topic, but it makes sense to revive this collaboration.
- We decided to gather **vocabularies** and **datasets** used by the various projects to make more clear where expertise in using these vocabularies lies. Knowing at a glance who else is using a particular dataset or vocabulary can be very helpful: you know on who’s door to knock if you have questions or want to share experiences.

A first version of the COMMIT Data and [Vocabulary](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vocabulary "Vocabulary") catalog is already online at:
