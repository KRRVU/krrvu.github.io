Our work on analysing the LOD cloud "[Observing the LOD Cloud using Equivalent Set Graphs: the LOD Cloud is mostly flat and sparsely linked](https://bibbase.org/network/publication/asprino-beek-ciancarini-vanharmelen-presutti-observingthelodcloudusingequivalentsetgraphsthelodcloudismostlyflatandsparselylinked-2019)" got accepted for ISWC 2019. A great example how a visit to our group lead to a really nice piece of work and a publication.
