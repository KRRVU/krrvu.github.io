One of the things that I think is great about the VU (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam) where I work is the promotion of interdisciplinary work through organizations like the Network Institute.  Computer Science is often known for interacting with biology, physics, and economics but we are now seeing the application of computing to Social Science problems. This is great for CS because domains often introduce new fundamental CS problems.

To talk about the overlap and potential opportunities for greater Social Science and Computer Science collaboration at the VU, Iina Hellsten (from Organization Science) and I organized a half-day symposium on Tuesday, June 29, 2010. We had a great environment for the discussion in the Intertain Lab (a space for investigating new interactive environments).

We had 17 participants about half from the Social Sciences (covering organization science, communication science, to psychology)  and half from Computer Science.

We started off with talks setting the scene from myself (on the CS side) and Peter Groenewegen and then moved to a series of shorter talks giving us a glimpse of the different focuses of some of the attendees. Even during these talks, there was clearly excitement about the possibilities for collaboration and there were several interesting conversations about the work itself.

The last part of the symposium was a session where we identified challenges and opportunities. We ran this as a post-it note session where each participant wrote two challenges and two opportunities on post it notes. (I got this idea from Katy Börner at her [NSF Workshop on Mapping of Science and the Semantic Web](http://scimaps.org/flat/meeting/100304/). Thanks Katy!). Amazingly, these post-it notes always cluster together. Below is an image of the results of the session:

The group identified 8 different groupings of the 60 challenges and opportunities listed by the participants. They were:

1. How do we bridge the vocabulary gap between social science and computer science?
2. We have the opportunity to build new applications using insights from social science.
3. Writing new proposals and fundraising.
4. Knowing who in the other discipline is working on a particular subject and maintaining connections between the disciplines.
5. Being able to answer new research questions.
6. Having an opportunity to apply research results in the “real world”.
7. Automating parts of social science analysis (think network extraction from data sets).
8. Overcoming the differing research styles of the two disciplines especially in terms of publication cycles.

Below we list the actual text of the post-it notes grouped into the 8 areas.

The outcome of the symposium is that now that we’ve identified clusters of challenges and opportunities, we need to focus on concrete collaborations to address these areas. We will hold another session in September to discuss concrete actions.

Overall, this event showed me that at the VU, we have both the right structures but the _right people_ to engage in this sort of interdisciplinary research.
