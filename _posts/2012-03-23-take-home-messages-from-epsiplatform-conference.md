Source: [Semantic Web world for you](http://semweb4u.wordpress.com/feed/) On March 16, 2012 the European Public Sector Information Platform organised the ePSIplatform Conference 2012 on the theme "Taking re-use to the next level!". A very well organised and interesting event, also a good opportunity to meet new persons and put a face on the names seen on the mails and during teleconferences :-)

The program was intense: 3 plenary sessions, 12 break-out sessions and project presentations during the lunch break. That was a lot to talk about and a lot to listen to. I left Rotterdam with a number of take out messages and food for thoughts. What follows is a mix of my own opinions and things said by some of the many participants/speakers of the event.![](http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=semweb4u.wordpress.com&blog=18410093&post=416&subd=semweb4u&ref=&feed=1)
