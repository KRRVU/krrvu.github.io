![](images/valorization-award.jpg) During the COMMIT/ Community event, April 2-3 in Lunteren, the Data2Semantics won one out of three COMMIT/ Valorization awards. The award is a 10000 euros subsidy to encourage the project to bring one of its products closer to use outside academia.

At the event, we presented and emphasized the philosophy of Data2Semantics to embed new enrichment tools in the current workflow of individual researchers. We are working closely with both [Figshare.com](http://figshare.com) (with our [Linkitup](http://linkitup.data2semantics.org) tool) and Elsevier Labs to bring semantics at the fingertips of the researcher.
