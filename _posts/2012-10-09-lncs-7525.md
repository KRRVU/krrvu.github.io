Literature is so much better in its electronic form but its still fun to get a physical copy. Most importantly, this proceedings represents scientific content and a scientific community that I’m proud to be be part of. You can obviously access the full [proceedings online](http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/book/978-3-642-34221-9). Preprints are also available from most of the author’s sites. You can also read [my summary](http://thinklinks.wordpress.com/2012/06/26/thoughts-from-ipaw-2012/) of the 4th International Provenance and Annotation Workshop (IPAW 2012) .
