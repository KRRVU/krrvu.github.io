The KRR group has been a wonderful home from many of us for years and even decades. In the past few years, however, we have grown enormeously both in terms of number of people as well as in the width of topics and expertise. There we have decided to continue as two groups, the Learning and Reasoning group (L&R) and the Knowledge in Artificial Intelligence (KAI) group. While we will continue to closely collaborate, and share our social identity, we also want to promote more clearly our various strengths and distinct profiles in research and teaching.
