Data2Semantics aims to provide essential semantic infrastructure for bringing [e-Science](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-Science "E-Science") to the next level.

A core task for scientific publishers is to speed up [scientific progress](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_progress "Scientific progress") by improving the availability of [scientific knowledge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science "Science"). This holds both for dissemination of results through traditional publications, as well as through the publication of [scientific data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data "Data"). The Data2Semantics project focuses on a key problem for data management in e-Science:

_How to **share**, **publish**, **access**, **analyse**, **interpret** and **reuse** data?_

Data2Semantics is a collaboration between the [VU University Amsterdam](http://www.vu.nl/ "Vrije Universiteit"), the [University of Amsterdam](http://www.uva.nl "University of Amsterdam"), [Data Archiving and Networked Services (DANS)](http://www.dans.knaw.nl/ "DANS") of the [KNAW](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_Netherlands_Academy_of_Arts_and_Sciences "Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences"), [Elsevier Publishing](http://www.elsevier.com) and [Philips](http://www.philips.com), andÂ is funded under the [COMMIT](http://www.commit-nl.nl) programme of the [NL Agency of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, Agriculture and Innovation](http://www.agentschapnl.nl/en "Agentschap NL").
