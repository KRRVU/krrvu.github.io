Source: [Semantic Web world for you](http://semweb4u.wordpress.com/feed/) Last week, I attended a seminar about "Understanding and Managing Complex Systems" organised by the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) together with the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO). The take home message from this seminar is that 1) Complex Systems are highly popular in Amsterdam, all the 200 available seats where taken the day the registration was open and 2) Complex Systems is the science of cooperation.![](http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=semweb4u.wordpress.com&blog=18410093&post=399&subd=semweb4u&ref=&feed=1)
