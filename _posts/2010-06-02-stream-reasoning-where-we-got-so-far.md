The idea of [Stream Reasoning](http://streamreasoning.org) originated in Politecnico di Milano in 2007, when [I](http://emanueledellavalle.org/) and [Stefano Ceri](http://dbgroup.como.polimi.it/ceri/) were helping writing the LarKC project proposal. In the last three years, lot of investigation has been done.

[Davide Barbieri](http://home.dei.polimi.it/dbarbieri/), [Daniele Braga](http://home.dei.polimi.it/braga/), [Stefano Ceri](http://dbgroup.como.polimi.it/ceri/), [Michael Grossniklaus](http://www.globis.ethz.ch/people/michagro), [I](http://emanueledellavalle.org/) defined the notion of RDF Stream together with an extension of SPARQL for continuous querying RDF Stream (i.e., our [C-SPARQL](http://wiki.larkc.eu/c-sparql/)). Most recently, we also investigated techniques for [incremental reasoning on RDF streams.](http://www.slideshare.net/emanueledellavalle/incremental-reasoning-on-streams-andrich-background-knowledge) I was invited to give a key note in [NeFoRS 2010](http://nefors10.larkc.eu/) and I though that I should have used this opportunity to tell where Stream Reasoning research got so far.

Thanks to [Frank van Harmelen](http://www.few.vu.nl/~frankh/) and [Heiner Stuckenschmidt](http://ki.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/people/heiner_stuckenschmidt.html) for helping spreading Stream Reasoning concept.  
Thereâ€™s much more to come.

Keep an eye on [http://streamreasoning.org](http://streamreasoning.org)
