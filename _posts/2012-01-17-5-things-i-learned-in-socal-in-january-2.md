I had a nice opportunity to start out this year with a visit to the [Information Sciences Institute](http://www.isi.edu) (ISI) in Southern California’s beautiful [Marina del Rey](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marina_del_Rey,_California) .  I did my postdoc with Yolanda Gil at ISI and we have continued to have an active collaboration, recently, doing work on using workflows for [exposing networks from linked data](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-783/paper1.pdf).

I always get a jolt of information visiting ISI. Here are five pointers to things I learned this time:

1\. The [Karma system](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hKqcmsvP0No) \[[github](https://github.com/InformationIntegrationGroup/Web-Karma-Public)\] is really leading the way on bringing data integration techniques to linked data. I’ll definitely be looking at Karma with respect to our development of the [Open PHACTS platform](http://www.openphacts.org).

2\. I’m excited about change detection algorithms in particular edit distance related measures for figuring out how to generate rich provenance information in the [Data2Semantics](http://www.data2semantics.org/) project. These are pretty well studied algorithms but I think we should be able to apply them differently. A good place to start is the paper:

- Sudarshan S. Chawathe, Anand Rajaraman, Hector Garcia-Molina, and Jennifer Widom. 1996. [Change detection in hierarchically structured information.](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=233366) _SIGMOD Rec._ 25, 2 (June 1996), 493-504. DOI=10.1145/235968.233366 http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/235968.233366

3\. Also with respect to provenance, after talking with [Greg Ver Steeg](http://www.isi.edu/people/gregv/about), I think [Granger Causality](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Granger_causality) and some of the other associated statistical models are worth looking at. Some pointers:

- [Information Transfer and Social Media](http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2724) by Greg Ver Steeg, Aram Galstyan
- [Granger causality and transfer entropy are equivalent for Gaussian variables](http://arxiv.org/abs/0910.4514) by Lionel Barnett, Adam B Barrett, Anil K. Seth

4\. [Tran Thanh](https://sites.google.com/site/kimducthanh/) gave a nice overview of his work on Semantic Search. I liked how he combined and extended the information retrieval and database communities work using Semantic Web techniques. Keyword: [Steiner Trees](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steiner_tree_problem)

5. [MadSciNetwork](http://www.madsci.org/) is a site where scientists answer questions from the public. This has been around since 1995. They have collected over 40,000 answered science questions. This corpus of questions is available at [MadSci Network Research](http://research.madsci.org/dataset/). Very cool.

Finally… it’s nice to visit southern california in January when you live in cold Amsterdam ![:-)](images/icon_smile.gif)
