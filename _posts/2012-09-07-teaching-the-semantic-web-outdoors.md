Today, I was teaching the second class of our Semantic Web class here at the [VU University Amsterdam](http://www.vu.nl) on RDF and RDFS. After the first half of the class in a very warm lecture room, the students were fading. After a quick poll, we decided to take the course outside. So I had the fun challenge of teaching off-the-cuff RDF Schema without a chalkboard and slides… and I think it actually worked. The students did a great job of participating and we managed to demonstrate a bit of rule based reasoning using a combination of coloured paper, students, and moving about. Here’s a photo of the class as we ended:
