LarKC - The Large Knowledge Collider has been nominated as a ’start project’ for the ICT 2010 event in Brussels. The project was present with a stand showcasing the life science and urban computing demonstrators, and the newly released LarKC Movie. The movie had its world premier on the first morning of the ICT event and triggered a lot of very positive feedback in course of the three-day event. The movie is published on the [project Web site](http://www.larkc.eu) and we invite you to enjoy the introduction to the LarKC project and its approach.

The LarKC consortium representatives thank the numerous visitors to the stand that have shown general interest in the project, that shared technical insights, that intend to exploit some of the project results or that might have ideas and visions to collaborate with LarKC or its members in future activities and projects.
