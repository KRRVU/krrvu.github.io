As a complement to two papers that we will present at the [ECML/PKDD 2013](http://www.ecmlpkdd2013.org/) conference in Prague in September we created a webpage with [additional material](http://www.data2semantics.org/publications/ecmlpkdd-2013/ "ECML/PKDD 2013").

The first paper: “A Fast Approximation of the Weisfeiler-Lehman Graph Kernel for RDF Data” was accepted into the main conference and the second paper: “A Fast and Simple Graph Kernel for RDF” was accepted at the DMoLD workshop.

We include links to the papers, to the software and to the datasets used in the experiments, which are stored in [figshare](http://figshare.com). Furthermore, we explain how to rerun the experiments from the papers using a precompiled JAR file, to make the effort required as minimal as possible.
