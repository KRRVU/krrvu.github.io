38 hours a week (1.0 fte) (for 48 months in total)

(Vacancy number DANS-2011-CEDARPhD1) (repeated call)

DANS in collaboration with the IISH, and the VU University [Amsterdam](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.3730555556,4.89222222222&spn=0.1,0.1&q=52.3730555556,4.89222222222 (Amsterdam)&t=h "Amsterdam") is working on a project of the Computational Humanities programme of the [KNAW](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.3715277778,4.89972222222&spn=0.01,0.01&q=52.3715277778,4.89972222222 (Royal%20Netherlands%20Academy%20of%20Arts%20and%20Sciences)&t=h "Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences") “Census data open linked – From fragment to fabric – Dutch census data in a web of global cultural and historic information (CEDAR)”

**Project Background**

This project builds a semantic data-web of historical information taking Dutch census data as a starting point. With such a web we will answer questions such as:

- What kind of patterns can we identify and interpret in expressions of regional identity?
- How to relate patterns of changes in skills and labor to technological progress and patterns of geographical migration?
- How to trace changes of local and national policies in the structure of communities and individual lives?

This project applies also a specific web-based [data-model](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model "Data model") – exploiting the [Resource Description Framework (RDF)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework "Resource Description Framework") technology– to make census data inter-linkable with other hubs of historical socio-economic and demographic data and beyond. The project will result in generic methods and tools to weave historical and socio-economic datasets into an interlinked semantic data-web. Further synergy will be created by linking CEDAR to Data2Semantics, a COMMIT project.

**Information on the position**

The PhD project, titled “[Linked Open Data](http://linkeddata.org/ "Linked Data") curation model in social science history – the case of Dutch census data” will be supervised by Professor [Frank van Harmelen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_van_Harmelen "Frank van Harmelen") (VU Amsterdam). You will work in a project team consisting of another PhD student (PhD project “Theory and Practice of data harmonization in social history” (under the supervison of Professor Kees Mandemakers (Erasmus School of History, Culture and Communication, [Erasmus University Rotterdam](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.9180555556,4.52583333333&spn=0.01,0.01&q=51.9180555556,4.52583333333 (Erasmus%20University%20Rotterdam)&t=h "Erasmus University Rotterdam"); IISH) and a postdoc experienced in complex network analysis and visualization.

- Review of existing [data models](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_model "Data model") of census data, adaptation and modification, construction of the RDF model, links to other semantic web sources
- Query design (specific to different user communities)
- Development of RDF models of census data (historical variables)
- Mapping of different ontologies across domains and along time,
- Development of best practices to enable take-up of linking and re-use of data in other scientific disciplines and take-up in other KNAW institutes.
- Visual navigation through RDF modelled information spaces
