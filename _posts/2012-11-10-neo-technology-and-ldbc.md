"Graphs are everywhere. Organizations of all sizes, from large enterprise to new startups, are embracing graph databases as the fastest way to query and store graph data. The EU has recognized this, and has funded the Linked Data Benchmark Council to promote and further the research in graph databases. We are grateful to the EU for recognizing the leading role of Neo4j in graph database adoption worldwide and have accepted its invitation join the research team, where we will be working closely with graph reseachers to set the next generation of industry standards and benchmarks."
