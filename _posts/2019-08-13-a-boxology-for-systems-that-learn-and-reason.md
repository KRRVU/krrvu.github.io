Annette and Frank have been teaching a seminar on "Combining Symbolic and Statistical approaches to AI" for three years now. The indefatigable reading of papers by our students and their insightful discussions lead to our [paper that gives an overview of the recent literature in the form of a boxology](https://bibbase.org/network/publication/vanharmelen-tenteije-aboxologyofdesignpatternsforhybridlearningandreasoningsystems-2019) (yes, it's an existing word, look it up in [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxology)!)
