The **KR&R** group investigates modelling and representation of different forms of knowledge and reasoning, as found in a large variety of [AI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence "Artificial intelligence") systems. We have an interest in both applications and theory. We study theoretical properties of [knowledge representation and reasoning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_representation_and_reasoning "Knowledge representation and reasoning") formalisms, but are also involved in developing practical [knowledge-based systems](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge-based_systems "Knowledge-based systems"). We have been very active in developments around the Semantic Web. We test and apply our insights in medical applications and in e-science (pharmacology, social science, humanities).
