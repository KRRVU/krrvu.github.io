While exploring the [London Science Museum](http://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/), I saw this great exhibit for [the Toaster Project](http://www.thetoasterproject.org/). The idea was to try to build a modern day toaster from scratch. There’s a video describing the project below and more info about the project from the site linked above.  What was interesting was that to get some information about how things were produced, Thomas Thwaites had to go look in some pretty old books to see how things get produced. I think it would be cool to make it easy to link  every product in my house to how to produce it (or how it was created) without going through a 9 month process to figure it out.
