Although LarKC is based in Europe, the project of building, and applying, web-scale reasoning is world wide. One of the most exciting things about living in a connected world, and a world of abundant, location independent computational resources, is that people anywhere in the world can do world class AI research, and develop applications based on that research. The recent, and very rapid, increase in [internet bandwidth going into Africa](http://www.moreintelligentlife.co.uk/content/ideas/jm-ledgard/digital-africa) means that one can now use [Shazam](http://www.shazam.com/) to get impromptu karaoke lyrics for the Texas country-and-western playing in a hotel bar in Accra. It also means that previously isolated African researchers can make a full contribution to the advance of semantic technology.  In February, partially supported by the [FP7 Active project](http://www.active-project.eu/), we had the opportunity to present LarKC, and the potential benefits of AI and human-computer collaboration, to students and researchers at the **[Ghana-India Kofi Annan Centre of Excellence in ICT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghana-India_Kofi_Annan_Centre_of_Excellence_in_ICT)** in Ghana. Discussion following the talks was lively, with great local ideas for the application of AI in knowledge capture from small farmers, and resource allocation for rural health care. Video from some talks is being made available on [VideoLectures.net](http://videolectures.net/), there was good coverage from the local media, and we look forward to building a collaboration with our new colleagues.
