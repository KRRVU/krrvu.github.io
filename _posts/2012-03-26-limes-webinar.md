On 27.03.2012, 04.00pm [CET](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Time "Central European Time") the LOD2 project ([http://lod2.eu](http://lod2.eu)) will offer the next free one hour [webinar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_conferencing "Web conferencing") on LIMES. LIMES is a tool providing time-efficient and lossless discovery of links across [knowledge bases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_base "Knowledge base"). LIMES is an extensible declarative framework that encapsulates manifold algorithms dedicated to the processing of structured data of any sort. Built with [extensibility](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extensibility "Extensibility") and easy integration in mind, LIMES allows implementing applications that integrate, consume and/or generate [Linked Data](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_Data "Linked Data"). Within LOD2, it will be used for discovering links between knowledge bases.

This webinar will be presented by the LOD2 Partner: [University of Leipzig](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=51.339,12.379&spn=1.0,1.0&q=51.339,12.379 (University%20of%20Leipzig)&t=h "University of Leipzig") (ULEI), [Germany](http://maps.google.com/maps?ll=52.5166666667,13.3833333333&spn=10.0,10.0&q=52.5166666667,13.3833333333 (Germany)&t=h "Germany")
