The university where I work asks us to register all our publications for the year in a central database \[1\].  Doing this obviously made me think of doing an [ego search](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egosurfing) on my academic papers. Plus, it’s the beginning of the year, which always seems like a good time to look at these things.

The handy tool [Publish-or-Perish](http://www.harzing.com/pop.htm) calculates all sorts of [citation metrics](http://library.amnh.org/research-tools/tips-tutorials/citation-metrics) based on a search of Google Scholar. The tool lets you pick the set of publications to consider. (For example, I left out all the publications from another [Paul Groth who’s a professor of architecture at Berkeley.](http://www.ced.berkeley.edu/ced/people/query.php?id=55)) I did a cursory run through to remove publications that weren’t mine but I didn’t spend much time so all the standard disclaimers app[](http://www.ced.berkeley.edu/ced/people/query.php?id=55)ly. There may be duplicates, it includes technical reports, etc. For transparency, you can find the set of publications considered in the Excel file [here](http://www.few.vu.nl/~pgroth/jan42011-publishorperish-google-scholar-citations.xlsx). Also, it’s worth noting that the [Google Scholar corpus has it’s own problems](http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6698580.html?q=jacso), in particular, it makes you look better. With all that in mind, let’s get to the fun stuff.

My stats as of Jan. 4, 2011 are:

- Papers:93,
- Citations:1318,
- Years:12,
- Cites/year:109.83,
- Cites/paper:14.17/4.0/0,
- Cites/author:416.35,
- Papers/author:43.27,
- Authors/paper:3.04/3.0/2,
- [h-index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index):21,
- [g-index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-index):34,
- hc-index:16,
- hI-index:5.58,
- hI-norm:11,
- AWCR:224.17,
- AW-index:14.97,
- AWCRpA:70.96,
- e-index:24.98,
- hm-index:9.07,

You can find the definitions for these metrics [here](http://www.harzing.com/pophelp/metrics.htm).

What does it all mean? I don’t know ![:-)](images/icon_smile.gif) I think it’s not half bad.

For comparison, here’s a [list of  the h-indexes for top computer scientist](http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~palsberg/h-number.html) computed using Google Scholar. All have  an h-index of 40 or greater. A quick scan through that least, shows that there’s a pretty strong correlation between being a top computer scientist and a high h-index. Thus, I conclude that I should continue concentrating on being a good computer scientists and the statistics will follow.

\[1\] I don’t know why my university doesn’t support importing publication information from bibtex, or RIS. Everything has to be added by hand, which takes a bit.
