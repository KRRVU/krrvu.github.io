We are proud to announce that the paper "[Complex Query Answering with Neural Link Predictors](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Mos9F9kDwkz)" by our PhD candidate Daniel Daza and Assist Prof. Michael Cochez along with our distinguished colleagues Erik Arakelyan and Pasquale Minervini (from UCL) got an [outstanding paper award](https://iclr-conf.medium.com/announcing-iclr-2021-outstanding-paper-awards-9ae0514734ab) (awarded to 8 papers out of 860 accepted papers) in ICLR 2021, a flagship conference in machine learning. Their work introduces novel techniques for efficient complex query answering in knowledge graphs embeddings, and brings significant improvements over the state-of-the-art.
