Data2Semantics was the local organizer for the [Beyond the PDF 2 conference](http://www.force11.org/beyondthepdf2). This conference brought together over 200 scholars, technologists, librarians and publishers to discuss the future of research communication. The conference had a huge social media presence with 3,500 tweets sent by 625 participants over the course of the two days. There were also lots of other outcomes.

This is another example of how Data2Semantics is reaching out to the scientific and research communities to push new ways of doing research.
