<table class="wp-block-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Artifical Intelligence ter voorkoming van su√Øcide</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Senior KR&amp;R member Zhisheng Huang has attracted much media attention in China with his AI-approach to detect potential suicide incidents. His lalgorithms rang postings on Chinese social media on a scale of 1 to 10, indindicating urgency, and then forwards these alerts to hundreds of volunteers across China. These volunteers then try to contact the message authors to assist them in finding help. The current count is at 662 prevented suicides, with more each day. Zhisheng used his recent holiday in China to give a large number of lectures and interviews on his initiative. He hopes that this will attract more volunteers. His algorithm currently reports 3000 alerts per day, so the human effort is current the bottleneck. More on his ork in an interview in <a href="https://krr.cs.vu.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Volkskrant-2019-08-27.jpg">De Volkskrant</a>.</td></tr></tbody></table>
